# 🧠 OrusProposalAgent

**OrusProposalAgent** is a full-stack, AI-driven RFP response platform that empowers teams to rapidly generate, refine, and collaborate on proposal content with the support of autonomous agents. Built for organizations pursuing government and enterprise contracts, the system combines cutting-edge natural language generation, real-time collaboration tools, and intelligent document workflows.

## 🧭 Vision

Responding to RFPs is traditionally a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone process. Teams often lose valuable hours coordinating SMEs, tracking edits, and ensuring compliance — all while under deadline pressure.

**OrusProposalAgent** transforms this process with:
- **Autonomous agent orchestration**: Specialized agents draft and revise proposal content aligned with technical requirements.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Team members can simultaneously review, annotate, and edit RFP responses in a secure shared environment.
- **Tool-augmented workflows**: Agents leverage domain-specific tools to insert compliance citations, rewrite text in requested tones, or translate customer requirements into technical responses.

Our goal is to help proposal teams spend less time formatting documents and more time winning contracts.

## 🌐 Use Case: RFP Response for IT Modernization
The platform is designed around three primary areas of focus:

### 1. AI and Agentic Tools
- Drafts full responses to AI-related RFP sections.
- Converts ambiguous prompts into structured technical strategies.
- Suggests realistic deployment plans, KPIs, and project milestones.

### 2. Cybersecurity
- Embeds NIST/FedRAMP-aligned language.
- Maps requirements to existing security frameworks.
- Generates policy-level responses based on uploaded governance docs.

### 3. Cloud Architecture (Microservices, Containers, Serverless)
- Describes architectures using cloud-native design patterns.
- Pulls from a library of reusable system diagrams and boilerplate.
- Adapts responses based on cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- Built in **React + TypeScript**
- Real-time document editing (collaboration layer in progress)
- Agent chat interface for Q&A, feedback, and prompt chaining
- File upload interface (DOCX/PDF)

### Backend
- **FastAPI** with modular routing
- REST endpoints for uploads, chat, memory, and auth
- Support for real-time sessions, agent context tracking
- Integration with OpenAI SDK + tool calls (Planned: Claude and OSS LLMs)

### Infra
- Dockerized local dev
- Designed for deployment on AWS Fargate or Lambda
- Planned integrations:
  - **Cognito** (user management)
  - **S3** (secure file storage)
  - **DynamoDB or Redis** (agent memory/session context)

## 💻 Local Development

### Requirements
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node 18+
- Python 3.10+

### Run Locally
```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose up --build
```
- Frontend at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend at: `http://localhost:8000`

## 📚 Key Components

### 🧠 Agents
The platform is built around the OpenAI Agents SDK. Agents:
- Persist user sessions
- Execute tool-based tasks (e.g., summarization, section rewriting)
- Use RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) for inserting compliance info

### ⚙️ Tools (Planned)
- `extract_sections`: Identify sections from uploaded RFP
- `map_to_requirements`: Align response to customer requirements
- `summarize_risks`: Generate mitigation plans
- `quote_regulation`: Insert relevant NIST/CISA language

### 📄 Document Workspace
- Multi-user editor (Yjs or Liveblocks planned)
- Response versioning
- Comment and review workflows (coming)

## 🧠 Philosophy
We believe proposal work is one of the best real-world applications of autonomous AI agents. It’s:
- Text-heavy
- High-stakes
- Deadline-driven
- Knowledge-rich

Our vision is to give proposal teams a smart copilot — not just for writing, but for reasoning, responding, and revising collaboratively.
